# zkproof

The `zkproof` directory contains the essential components for generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs (zk proofs) within the Zkam project. The key files include:

- **`circuits/zkam/zkam.circom`**: Defines the circuits used for zk proof generation.
- **`circuits/zkam/compile.sh`**: A script to compile the Circom circuits.
- **`package.json`** and **`yarn.lock`**: Manage dependencies required for working with the zk circuits.

This directory is central to the cryptographic functions of the project, facilitating secure proof generation and verification processes.
