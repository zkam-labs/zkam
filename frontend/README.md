# Frontend

The Zkam frontend serves as the user interface for interacting with zk circuits. It is built using TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and clean design. The codebase is structured as follows:

- **`src/`**: Contains the main application source code.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable UI components.
  - **`contracts/`**: Smart contract-related files, including Solidity contracts and their configurations.
  - **`data/`**: State management and data handling utilities.
  - **`helpers/`**: Utility functions that assist with various tasks like hashing and image generation.
  - **`lib/`**: General-purpose libraries and utilities.
- **`public/`**: Holds static assets such as images and icons.

The project setup includes ESLint for code quality, Tailwind for styling, and Vite for efficient building and development. The frontend is designed to be easy to navigate and maintain, with a focus on modularity and reusability.
