# Frontend

The zkam frontend is a user interface for interacting with zk circuits. The project is built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, providing a simple and responsive design. The codebase is organized with a src directory for source code and a public directory for static assets, making it easy to navigate and maintain.
